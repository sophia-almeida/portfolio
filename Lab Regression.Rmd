```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load Data


```{r load}

library(ggplot2)
library(lattice)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(caret)
library(dplyr)

library(readr)
airfares <- read.csv("Airfares.csv", header = TRUE)
head(airfares, 10)




```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
